From version 3 a set of symbolic links from MaMaMediaMenu.activity are needed, because of issues with security when using shared code based on anyther activity bundle.

The code is still living inside the MaMaMediaMenu source tree, but gets included in this bundle from MANIFEST inclusion.

ln -s ../MaMaMedia.activity/mmm_modules .
ln -s ../MaMaMedia.activity/icons mamamedia_icons

substitute ../MaMaMedia.activity with wherever you have MaMaMedia bundle installed.
